## Installation, Updating

### Installing:

When it comes to installing the plugin, Simply drop the HyperVision-[version number].jar into your servers plugin folder and then start your server.

### Updating:

Updating is very easy, all you're needing to do is download the new version of the plugin and replace the old version in your plugins folder.
